
ZK PROJECT:

how to verify a transaction? imagine an equation, zk provide a proof that help verify the equation. 
	SEMAPHORE:
		prove that you are a member of a group without providing who you are. 
		the package proof allows us to create a proof
		cli is for create a project : semaphore create <name>
		
	
	UNIREP Protocol:
		-trustlist
		-UniRep contract
		-protocol: 
			- user provide proof, the attester relay and verify it and after the user can get the date of the smart contract
		-EOA attester: setup rules on how the user can get data
		-epoch key, it's the only usable thing of unirep, that allws us not to reveal the data of users

SAFE:

Smart contracts as wallets
	need a registry for A and one for B, and with an adress we can provide the functionality
	-Auth kit: advance tokenisation
	-Protocol kit: to integrate and deploy
	-Onramp kit:  
	-Relay kit: execute the batch transaction without paying the gas 
	




FIRST WORK WITH SAFE [CORE]

-create smart contracts for anonymous wallets and use the protocol kit to aliment it
